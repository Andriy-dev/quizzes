List heap use cases
===================

* To quickly find the smallest and largest element from a collection of items or array.
* In the implementation of the Priority queue in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm (shortest path), Prim's algorithm (minimum spanning tree) and Huffman encoding (data compression).
* In order to overcome the Worst-Case Complexity of Quick Sort algorithm from O(n^2) to O( nlog(n) ) in Heap Sort.
* For finding the order in statistics.
* Systems concerned with security and embedded system such as Linux Kernel uses+ Heap Sort because of the O( nlog(n) ).
