# Yaml 

YAML is a data serialization languages. We can use YAML do define key-value pairs. Yaml is very similar to JSON - JavaScrip Object Notation. Defined in https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html

Serialization languages:
YAML
JSON
XML

YAML is designed to be human readable. Two extensions is acceptable .yml / .yaml. 

Both JSON and YAML aim to be human readable data interchange formats. However, JSON and YAML have different priorities. JSON’s foremost design goal is simplicity and universality. Thus, JSON is trivial to generate and parse, at the cost of reduced human readability. It also uses a lowest common denominator information model, ensuring any JSON data can be easily processed by every modern programming environment.

In contrast, YAML’s foremost design goals are human readability and support for serializing arbitrary native data structures. Thus, YAML allows for extremely readable files, but is more complex to generate and parse. In addition, YAML ventures beyond the lowest common denominator data types, requiring more complex processing when crossing between different programming environments.

YAML can therefore be viewed as a natural superset of JSON, offering improved human readability and a more complete information model. This is also the case in practice; every JSON file is also a valid YAML file. This makes it easy to migrate from JSON to YAML if/when the additional features are required.

Sequence of Scalars:

- "Hardik Parekh"
- "Denada Kapaj"
- "Aris Papathanasiou"

YAML allow us to define variables, for example ( Mapping Scalar to Scalar)

name: "Andrew"
department: "Engineering"

YAML allows us to define objects: 

person:
    name: "andrew"
    department: "Engineering"

 Scope is defined with identattion. 

 In addition to variables we can define lists: (Mapping Scalar to Sequence)
 
First type of list definition

person:
   name: "andrew"
   department: "Engineering"
   designs_delivered:
    - "K8s v1"
    - "K8s v2"
    - "K8s v3"
    - "Inra&Prime Rack LLD"

Second type of list definition

person:
   name: "andrew"
   department: "Engineering"
   designs_delivered:
    - "K8s v1"
    - "K8s v2"
    - "K8s v3"
    - "Inra&Prime Rack LLD"
   team: ["Aris", "Joeri", "Aman" ]

Complex lists are supported:

person:
   name: "andrew"
   department: "Engineering"
   designs_delivered:
    - "K8s v1"
    - "K8s v2"
    - "K8s v3"
    - "Inra&Prime Rack LLD"
  team: ["Aris", "Joeri", "Aman" ]        
  peers:
    - name: "Hardik"
      department: "Operations"
      designs_implemented: "5000"
    - { name: "Denada", department: "Operatiosn", last_maintenance: "MacSec" }
    -
      name: "Omkar"
      departnemt: "Operations"

Above doing the same thing - storing the information. 

We can encode a lot of information (> - single line)
